The new way to learn a language!

ChatrAI is the first project I've been truly excited about in quite some time -- the idea is to create a language learning tool that will help intermediate
learners practice reading conversations in foreign languages about anything & everything. 
I'm finally at a point in my life where I can dedicate a significant amount of time to creating something like this, 
having graduated from Boston College in May of 2023, and I could not be more excited! I am confident that it will be the perfect way to 
keep my skills sharp going into my first full time role in Q1 2024!

I'm gonna give this project my all -- ChatrAI is an app that I can and will use. It's interesting, it's fun, and it's powered by AI!

All has gone well with the code so far. Users can now sign in with Google accounts, the Firebase for the project is (somewhat) configured, and everything
is running smoothly with version control via SourceTree & GitHub. 

So excited for the challenges ahead. 

Time to get to work!
