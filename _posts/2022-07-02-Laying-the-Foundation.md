It's finally time to get the foundations set for the project, which I've officially decided to name FourFour! Since the app will be a practice tool that encourages regularly scheduled practicing, I thought the concept of 4/4, which is referred to as "Common Time" when discussing time signatures, would be a nice name as both a musical term and a nod to practicing consistency. 

Set-up has been going well so far. One of the pieces of this project that I was especially excited for was building my own APIs from scratch, since my iOS experience to this point has largely revolved around the mythical Google Firebase and its many beyond-polished tools. While it's fun, efficient, and practical to work with Firebase, I really wanted to build from the ground up, just to get a better sense of how it all works. 

Choosing Flask was a no-brainer for me - it's the only web framework that I already had decent familiarity with coming into this project (from some past startup gigs and internships). I'm also a big fan of Python and it's the language I have the second most experience with (after Swift), so not having to worry about learning a bunch of new syntax was really nice in the already challenging process of building my first full API. 

So far, the process is going well. I'm using a MongoDB Atlas database which is empty at the moment, but setting up the account, security, and connection was a rewarding challenge in itself. I'm excited about using a cloud database like this. The whole idea of accessing an entire cluster with one pymongo client seems to be a significant positive in terms of scaling, since there can be many databases with nested collections all referenced by that single object. I'm really looking forward to building my familiarity with mongo over the course of this project; it definitely appears to be an industry leader at the moment. 

As far as the API itself, progress is going well there too. I'm using Postman to test my endpoints, and I've just sucessfully written my first GET method which returns some JSON formatted test data. Looking forward to writing more complex functionality in the coming days, starting with CRUD and maybe working up to some more complex features later. 

Finally, the project containing the app itself has also been created. So far my progress is mostly just organizational. I've created groups for views, models, viewmodels, and extensions so far, and I'm excited to keep a clean, organzied, and well-documented codebase moving forward. I've also started a bit of preliminary work with coloring and styling, which is going well!

I'm proud to say that I've done all of this honoring my "docs first" goal. While I have had to reference my past projects and external resources a bit as well, it really does help to at least understand the concepts first through the docs, so I'm glad I am taking this approach. 

Next steps will be to continue building out the API, and get my repos up on my GitHub profile.

STOKED :)
