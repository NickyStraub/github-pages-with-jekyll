Hello and welcome to The Orange Bird!

Thanks for checking out my blog! My name is Nicholas Straub, but I go by Nicky. I'm a software developer based out of Boston, where I'm currently a rising Senior pursuing a double major in CS and Econ at Boston College. 

Since my first taste of Swift about a year ago, I've been obsessed with making apps. I love the experience of buidling something from the ground up, I love the satisfaction of tackling difficult challenges, and I love the idea of making things that help other people. Most of all, I love being creative. 

I decided to start this blog because I want to contribute to the ecosystem of iOS devs that has helped me countless times throughout my journey with app development. 

Today, I am starting my first large-scale, completely independent project. My goal is to create a fully open-source iOS app for musicians, which will serve as a motivational tool for practicing, a reference for learning theory and songwriting, and more. 

Some things that will be unique about this project for me include: 
- The project will be completely independent, whereas all of my past large-scale projects have been with a team
- The project will have an open-source, regularly updated GitHub repo
- I'll be talking about my progress and sharing my thoughts on various issues surrounding the project on this blog
- I'll be attacking problems with a documentation-first approach, meaning I want to rely a bit less on tutorials/forums and more on reading docs

I'm so excited to get started, and I hope that some of the things I talk about on this page will be of use to other devs out there! 

Thanks again for stopping by!
